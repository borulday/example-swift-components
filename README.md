## Example swift components

This project is just for testing "Connected Components" feature.

After downloading/cloning the repository delete `.zeplin` folder and create on your own locally.

To connect your Swift components run the command below:

`zeplin connect`

Now your components should be connected! 🎊

To use Zeplin CLI on developer mode:

`zeplin connect --dev`

☝️ *No need to add plugins you use to terminal command since we added the plugins into the `components.json` file.*
